# 0x11. C - printf

## ALX School First Group Project.
A custom C printf function made by Akor Sunday and Chy Ameh

### Goals

- To write our own printf function in C.
- The printf function is capable of printing with the %d, %c, %s, and %% specifiers to standard output.
- The print function should return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte at the end of strings). We were not asked to handle flag   characters, field width, precision, or length.
